    <h1>Data Deletion Instructions for DirecTG</h1>

    <p>This page provides instructions on how you can manage and delete your data within the DirecTG application.</p>

    <h2>Types of Data Processed</h2>
    <p>DirecTG processes the following types of data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Call Log Information:</strong> DirecTG accesses your call log to identify phone numbers, particularly those not in your contacts. This data is processed ephemerally (temporarily, in memory) to suggest numbers and is not permanently stored by the app, except as described below for the "History" feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Contacts Information:</strong> DirecTG accesses your contacts list to differentiate between numbers already saved in your contacts and those that are not. This data is also processed ephemerally and not permanently stored by the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Manually Entered Phone Numbers:</strong> Phone numbers you manually type into the app are processed to generate Telegram links. These are also processed ephemerally, except as described below for the "History" feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Search History:</strong> For your convenience, DirecTG locally stores a history of phone numbers (from your call log or manually entered) for which you have generated Telegram links. This history is stored <strong>only on your device</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Delete Your Data</h2>
    <p>You have full control over the "Search History" data stored by DirecTG on your device. Other data (Call Log, Contacts, manually entered numbers for immediate processing) is not persistently stored by the app beyond its immediate use or is only read from your device's system.</p>

    <p>To delete your Search History in DirecTG:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the DirecTG application on your device.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the "History" section within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>To delete an individual history entry:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Tap the 'Delete' icon, and then confirm in dialogue window.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>To delete all history entries at once:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Tap 'Delete' icon at the top of the History section, then confirm.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once deleted through these steps, the history entries are permanently removed from your device's storage for DirecTG.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Data processed ephemerally (Call Log, Contacts for immediate processing) is not retained by the app.</p>
    <p>Search History data is retained on your device until you choose to delete it using the methods described above. There is no additional retention period for data you delete from the history.</p>
    <p>No data is transmitted to or stored on our servers.</p>
