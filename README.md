# Privacy Policy for DirecTG

Last Updated: August 02, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how DirecTG collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our DirecTG mobile application (the "App").

# Information We Collect
To provide its core functionality, DirecTG requires access to the following information on your device:
* Call Log Data: We access your call log to identify phone numbers, particularly those not saved in your contacts, to allow you to find corresponding Telegram accounts.
* Contacts Data: We access your contacts to differentiate between numbers already saved in your contacts and those that are not. This helps in presenting you with a list of numbers from your call log that are not in your contacts.

DirecTG also processes phone numbers that you manually enter into the App.

# How We Use Your Information
The information collected is used solely for the following purposes:
* Core App Functionality:
  * To identify phone numbers from your call log.
  * To filter out numbers from your call log that are already present in your contacts list, providing you with a list of "unknown" (not in contacts) numbers from your call history.
  * To process phone numbers (from call log or manually entered) to generate a potential Telegram account link.
* User Convenience (History Feature):
  * The App locally stores a history of phone numbers (both from the call log and manually entered) for which you have generated Telegram links. This history is stored only on your device and is provided for your convenience.
 
# Data Storage and Handling
* Call Log and Contacts Data Processing: Information from your call log and contacts is processed ephemerally within the App to provide the core functionality. This data is not transmitted from your device to us or any third party.
* History Feature: The history of numbers used to generate Telegram links is stored locally on your device only. You have full control over this history and can delete individual entries or clear the entire history at any time from within the App settings. This history data is not transmitted from your device to us or any third party.
* No Server Storage: We do not store your call log data, contacts data, or your history of processed numbers on any external servers. All processing and storage (for the history feature) occurs on your device.

# Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information (including call log data, contacts data, or manually entered numbers) with any third parties. All data accessed and processed by DirecTG remains on your device, except for the history feature which is also stored locally on your device.

# Third-Party SDKs
DirecTG does not use any third-party Software Development Kits (SDKs) for analytics, advertising, or any other purpose.

# Advertising
DirecTG does not contain any advertisements.

# Children's Privacy
DirecTG is intended for a general audience and is not specifically directed at children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, please contact us at [kadman@mail.ru], and we will take steps to remove such information.

# Your Choices and Rights
* Permissions: You can control the App's access to your Call Log and Contacts through your device's permission settings. Please note that revoking these permissions will prevent the core functionalities of the App from working.
* History Deletion: You can delete individual entries from your search history or clear the entire history within the App at any time.

# Security
We take reasonable precautions to protect the information processed by DirecTG. Since data is primarily processed ephemerally or stored locally on your device (for the history feature), the security of this data largely depends on the security of your own device.

# Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on the App's store listing page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.
